# Cipher Challenge for Stack Sports

<br>

This is my response to the Cipher Challenge offered by Stack Sports as part of the interview process. 

<br>

## Goals

Upon completion this project will 
-contain the code used for encryption of the original source files provided by Stack Sports.
-reflect an effort to derive a cipher key and decode provided text.
-have a creative and fun front end with animatios and media queries, including some Bootstrap elements
<!-- The site will employ Webpack, Bootstrap and Bable. -->

<br>

## Tech Used:

<li>React</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<!-- <li>Babel</li>
<li>Webpack</li> -->

<br>

## Mobile Responsive

<!-- The site makes does not yet use media queries. Check it out in responsive mode in Chrome dev tools. -->

<br>

## Animation 

<!-- Text animates in dramatically when decrypted -->
<!-- Intro page uses on hover to reveal hidden images/elements -->
